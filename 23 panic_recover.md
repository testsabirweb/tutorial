## panic and recover (Avoid if possible)

***panic*** and ***recover*** are mechanisms for dealing with exceptional or unexpected situations, allowing you to handle errors gracefully and avoid program termination. They are typically used in situations where the program encounters a severe error that it cannot recover from in a normal flow.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func recoverFromPanic() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Using defer to call recoverFromPanic in case of a panic
    defer recoverFromPanic()

    // Simulating a panic
    panic("A critical error occurred!")

    // This line will not be executed because of the panic
    fmt.Println("This line will not be executed.")
}
```

*Go encourages the use of explicit error handling using return values or error types. This approach makes the code more explicit about potential failure points and enhances code readability.*
